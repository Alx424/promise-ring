# Welcome to my Expo app project! ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Overview

For this project, I will gain experience with using React to build an app template for an idea I have!

I want to make an app to help users keep track of their recovery journey against addiction. It will include motivational messages written by users that are/who have been in a similar situation to the user. The app will also have a milestones page to time how long the user abstains and award badges as an incentive depending on how long they go.

I plan on pairing this project with a concept I have of a ring which connects to the user's devices by Bluetooth and has a "panic button" which, when pressed, redirects all connected devices to this app.

However, this is more so a project for me to practice creating an app using React!
